# Metatube / landing-page

> Landing page for Metatube project by [neetGroup](https://neetgroup.net).

## Metatube

Metatube is a next generation media/content sharing platform. As where Youtube has been silencing voices that don't coincide with it's shareholders (being a private company), Metatube is a redesign of the entire media network paradigm. Allowing content creators to monetize any and all content, giving them more monetization options, and giving content consumers a more secure channel to consume from.
